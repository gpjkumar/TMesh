Internet-Draft                    tmesh                         May 2015


1.  Introduction

      this is a work in progress and under active development, expect
      significant breaking changes

   As embedded devices continue to increase in capabilities while
   falling in cost there is a growing challenge to manage their energy
   resources for wirelessly networking them together.  While there are
   many options for short-range 2.4GHz networks such as Bluetooth Smart
   (BLE), low-power WiFi, Zigbee and 802.15.4 based mesh networks, there
   are few choices for long-range sub-GHz mesh networking.

   TMesh builds on the strong end-to-end encryption and privacy
   capabilities of [telehash v3] by adding a uniquely matched secure
   Physical RF and Media Access Control protocol.

   The key attributes of TMesh are:

   o  high density - thousands per square kilometer

   o  very low power - years on coin cell batteries

   o  wide area - optimized for long-range (>1km) capable radios

   o  high latency - low minimum duty cycle from seconds to minutes

   o  peer aware meshing - does not require dedicated coordinator
      hardware

   o  high interference resiliency - bi-modal PHY to maximize
      connectivity in all conditions

   o  dynamically resource optimized - powered motes naturally provide
      more routing assistance

   o  zero metadata broadcast - same absolute privacy and security
      principles as telehash

   o  dynamic spectrum - able to use any specialized private or
      regionally licensed bands

1.1.  The Need for Standards

   The existing best choices are all either only partial solutions like
   802.15.4, require membership to participate like LoRaWAN, ZigBee, and
   Z-Wave, or are focused on specific verticals like DASH7 and Wireless
   M-Bus.

Internet-Draft                    tmesh                         May 2015


   All other options only provide incomplete or indadequate security and
   privacy, most use only optional AES-128 and often with complicated or
   fixed provisioning-based key management.  No existing option fully
   protects the mote identity and network metadata from monitoring.

1.2.  Telehash Native

   By leveraging telehash [1] as the native encryption and mote identity
   platform, TMesh can start with some strong assumptions:

   o  each mote will have a unique stable 32-byte identity, the hashname

   o  two linked motes will have a unique long-lived session id, the
      routing token

   o  all payloads will be encrypted ciphertext with forward secrecy

   o  retransmissions and acknowledgements happen at a higher level and
      are not required in the framing

   o  motes are members of a private mesh and only communicate with
      other verified members

   o  chunked encoding defines how to serialize variable length packets
      into fixed transmission frames

1.3.  Vocabulary

   o  "mote" - a single physical transmitting/receiving device

   o  "medium" - definition of the specific channels/settings the
      physical transceivers use

   o  "knock" - a single transmission

   o  "window" - the period for a knock, 2^22 microseconds (~4.2
      seconds)

   o  "window sequence" - each window will change frequency/channels in
      a sequence

   o  "epoch" - one unique set of window sequences, derived from a
      medium and a secret

   o  "neighborhood" - the list of known nearby motes using a shared
      medium

   o  "z-index" - the self-asserted resource level (priority) from any
      mote

   o  "leader" - the highest z-index visible in any mote's neighborhood

1.4.  Overview

   TMesh is the composite of three distinct layers, the physical radio
   medium encoding (PHY), the shared management of the spectrum (MAC),
   and the networking relationships between 2+ motes (Mesh).

   Common across all of these is the concept of an "epoch", which is a
   generated set of unique window sequences shared between two motes in
   one "medium".  A "window" is where one "knock" can occur from one
   mote to another unique to that window and epoch.  A "knock" is the
   transmission of a 64 byte fixed frame of payload, plus any medium-
   specific overhead (preamble).

   Each epoch is the smallest divisible unit of bandwidth and is only
   capable of a max throughput of 120 bits per second average,
   approximately 1 kilobyte per minute.  Every mote has at least one
   receiving epoch and one sending epoch per link to another mote, and
   will typically have multiple epochs with other motes to increase the
   overall bandwidth capacity and minimize latency.

   The number and types of epochs available depend entirely on the
   current energy budget, every epoch type has a fixed minimum energy
   cost per window to send/receive based on the medium settings.

1.4.1.  PHY

   A "medium" is defined with 6 bytes that specify the type and exact
   PHY encoding details.  The 6 bytes are often encoded as 10 base32
   characters for ease of use in JSON and configuration storage.

   The first byte is a fixed "type" that determines the category of PHY
   encoding technique to use, often these are different modes on
   transceivers or different drivers entirely.

   Each PHY driver uses the second through fifth medium bytes to
   determine the power, frequency range, number of channels, spreading,
   bitrate, error correction usage, regulatory requirements, channel
   dwell time, etc details on the transmission/reception.  The actual
   channel frequency hopping and transmission window timing are derived
   from the full epoch and not included in the medium.

   The last (6th) byte is a fixed "divider" that lowers the density of
   available windows in an epoch.  This enables two motes to greatly

   reduce the time required waking and listening for low power and high
   latency applications. (format TBD)

   Transmitted payloads do not need whitening as encrypted packets are
   by nature DC-free.  They also do not explicitly require CRC as all
   telehash packets have authentication bytes included for integrity
   verification.

   A single fixed 64 byte payload is transmitted during each window in
   an epoch, this is called a "knock".  If the un-encrypted payload does
   not fill the full 64 byte frame the remaining bytes must contain
   additional data so as to not reveal the actual payload size.

      WIP - determine a standard filler data format that will add
      additional dynamically sized error correction, explore taking
      advantage of the fact that the inner and outer bitstreams are
      encrypted and bias-free (Gaussian distribution divergence?), the
      last byte should always duplicate the first/length to ensure
      differentiation between payload/filler

1.4.2.  MAC

   There is no mote addressing or other metadata included in the
   transmitted bytes, including there being no framing outside of the
   encrypted ciphertext in a knock.  The uniqueness of each epoch's
   timing and PHY encoding is the only mote addressing mechanism.

   Every epoch is a unique individual encrypted session between the two
   motes, with a shared secret key derived directly from the medium and
   other sources, and nonce based on the current window sequence.  All
   payloads are encrypted with the ChaCha20 cipher [2] before
   transmission regardless of if they are already encrypted via
   telehash.

   Each mote should actively make use of multiple epochs to another mote
   and regularly include more efficient options to optimize the overall
   energy usage.  Every mote advertises their current energy resource
   level as a "z-index" as an additional mesh optimization strategy.

1.4.3.  Mesh

   There is two mechanisms used for enabling a larger scale mesh network
   with TMesh, "neighborhoods" (MAC layer) and "routers" (telehash/app
   layer).

   A "neighborhood" is defined by motes using a shared medium and the
   automatic sharing of other motes that it has active epochs with in
   that medium.  Each neighbor mote hashname is listed along with time



Miller                  Expires November 17, 2015               [Page 6]

   offset, last activity, z-index, and the signal strength.  A mote may
   be part of more than one neighborhood but does not share neighbor
   mote information outside of each one.

   A "router" is always the neighbor with the highest z-index in the
   local neighborhood.  The router inherits the responsibility to
   monitor each neighbor's neighborhood for other routers and establish
   direct or bridged links with them.  Any mote with a packet for a non-
   local hashname will send it to the neighborhood router, whom will
   send it to the next highest router it is connected to until it
   reaches the highest in the full neighborhood mesh.  That highest
   resourced router is responsible for maintaining an index of all
   available motes/hashnames in the full neighborhood mesh.


2.  Protocol Definition

2.1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC
   2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant TMesh
   implementations.

2.2.  PHY

2.2.1.  Private Hopping Sequence

   Most PHY encodings require specific synchronized channel and timing
   inputs, these are generated from the epoch's 32 byte secret via a
   consistent transformation.

   An eight byte null/zero pad is encrypted with the current epoch
   secret/nonce for each window and the ciphertext result is used for
   channel selection and window timing.

   The first two bytes of the ciphertext result is used for channel
   selection as a network order unsigned short integer.  The 2^16 total
   possible channels are simply mod'd to the number of usable channels
   based on the current medium.  If there are 50 channels, it would be
   "channel = ((uint16_t)pad) % 50".

   The next four bytes (32 bits) are used as the window microsecond
   offset timing source as a network order unsigned long integer.  Each
   window is up to 2^22 microseconds, but every medium will have a fixed
   amount of time it takes to send or receive within that window and
   that is first subtracted from the total possible microseconds.  The

   remaining microsecond offset start times are mod'd to get the exact
   offset for that window.

2.3.  MAC

2.3.1.  Encrypted Knock Payload

   A unique 32 byte secret must be derived for every epoch and include
   the medium definition.  The additional sources for the secret depend
   on the context in which the epoch is used, and may range from a well-
   known fixed value (for discovery), shared value (for mesh, echos), or
   ephemeral value (pairing, private motes).  The 32 bytes the binary
   digest output of a SHA-256 calculation of the combined sources.

   The nonce input is always the epoch's current window sequence encoded
   as a network order unsigned double integer ("uint64_t") 8 bytes.

2.3.2.  Epoch Types

   There are currently five different types of epochs defined:

   o  "PING" - when detected, only used as a source to generate an echo

   o  "ECHO" - only used for one-time creation of a "PAIR"




Miller                  Expires November 17, 2015               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                    tmesh                         May 2015


   o  "PAIR" - only used to send initial handshakes to establish a new
      link

   o  "MESH" - encrypted telehash packets for an established link

   o  "MOTE" - private epoch only between two motes

2.3.2.1.  PING

   A "PING" epoch is only used as a transmission timing signal on window
   sequence "0".  The payload is not used to send/receive any content
   and is only deciphered as a source to generate an "ECHO".

   When two motes have a shared secret to create this type of epoch they
   can then use available energy to listen for a "PING" knock at any
   time on the given channel for sequence "0".  When detected, the
   relevant "ECHO" can be generated and sent/received in the next window
   relative to the "PING" knock.

2.3.2.2.  ECHO

   An "ECHO" epoch is the one-time response to a detected "PING" knock
   and only exists to assist with the establishment of one-time "PAIR"
   epochs for the handshaking process.

   The secret for an "ECHO" epoch is derived from the medium and the
   deciphered payload of the "PING".  For discovery the payload of a
   transmitted "PING" must be used as another source, whereas in a
   neighborhood the receiving mote's hashname is the additional source
   to generate the secret.

   The single "ECHO" knock is always set to window sequence "1" relative
   to the received "PING" at sequence "0".

   The payload is a pair of new ephemeral "PAIR" secrets, one for tx and
   one for rx.

2.3.2.3.  PAIR

   A pair of temporary "PAIR" epochs only follow an "ECHO" and are only
   used to send/receive chunk-encoded handshakes to establish a telehash
   link.

   Any "PAIR" epochs defined in the encrypted handshakes will have the
   same time base as the original "PING" and begin at the correct window
   sequences based on that.

Internet-Draft                    tmesh                         May 2015


2.3.2.4.  MESH

   All "MESH" epochs follow a successful "PAIR" or are triggered by an
   out-of-band synchronization, their medium, time base, and unique
   epoch ID are a result of those processes.

   The secret for a "MESH" epoch is always derived from the hashnames of
   the two motes.  All knocks are chunk-encoded encrypted telehash
   packets.

   When using "MESH" in a neighborhood and sharing the time offsets of
   neighbors, any mote can then calculate keep-out channels and times of
   other motes based on their shared "MESH" epochs and optimize overall
   medium usage.  In this way, the "MESH" epoch acts as a higher QoS
   path between motes.

2.3.2.5.  MOTE

   A "MOTE" epoch is any privately shared and generated one between two
   motes.  These are created dynamically as needed to increase the
   bandwidth available and may have a lower QoS as they can overlap with
   other nearby motes.

   Every mote should continually try new "MOTE" epochs with a higher
   energy efficiency as a method to optimize communication, reserving
   the "MESH" epochs for only when the "MOTE" epochs are not performing
   or for higher priority packets.

2.4.  Mesh

2.4.1.  Discovery

   When a new un-linked mote must be introduced directly into a mesh and
   there is no out-of-band mechanism to bootstrap mote keys and time
   sync, a special temporary discovery mode may be enabled on any
   existing mote to assist.  Both motes must have the same discovery
   medium and secret for this process to work.

   The discovery epoch is used as a "PING" for both motes, with each of
   them transmitting their ping knocks containing offers.  Since they
   will both be using the same PHY channel, if possible they should
   first listen for a transmission in progress before sending another
   offer to minimize interference.

   The discovery ping knocks must always have a random 64 byte payload
   so that even if the secret is known, it is not possible for a third
   party to determine if the knock was a ping or not.  It is also always
   set to window sequence 0 so that the PHY is stable since the time of

   the windowing is not.

   Once one ping knock has been both sent and received the mote may then
   derive a compatible "BASE" epoch and send a knock on it or listen for
   other base knocks.

   Upon receiving any "BASE" knock the mote should immediately create
   the pair of "INIT" epochs and begin sending/receiving unencrypted
   handshakes until a "LINK" epoch is established.

   This functionality should not be enabled/deployed by default, it
   should only be used when management policy explicitly requires it for
   special/public use cases or temporary pairing/provisioning setup.

2.4.2.  Neighborhoods

      Describe neighborhoods and routers, and routers performing ongoing
      sync-mode duties.

2.4.2.1.  Sync

   The sync mode takes advantage of the fact that every epoch makes use
   of a shared medium that is divided into channels, such that every
   sync epoch will have some overlap with other private link epochs that
   a mote is transmitting on.  When any mote sends any knock that
   happens to be on the same channel as one of their "PING" epoch's
   (sequence 0), they should then attempt to receive an "ECHO" knock
   exactly one window period after the transmission.

   The local leader should attempt to maximize their use of sync epoch
   overlapping channels to allow for fast resynchronization to them,
   even to the point of sending arbitrary/random knocks on that channel
   if nothing has been transmitted recently.  When a mote detects that
   it is disconnected, it should also send regular knocks on the sync
   epoch channels of nearby known motes.

2.4.3.  z-index

   Every mote calculates its own "z-index", a uint8_t value that
   represents the resources it has available to assist with the mesh.
   It will vary based on the battery level or fixed power, as well as if
   the mote has greater network access (is an internet bridge) or is
   well located (based on configuration).

   The mote with the highest "z-index" in any neighborhood is known as
   the "local leader".

   The z-index also serves as a window mask for all of that mote's

   receiving epoch windows by powers of two.

2.4.4.  Neighborhood Map

   Each mote should share enough detail about its neighborhood with
   every neighbor so that a map can be built.  This includes the
   relative sync time of each epoch and the current routing token in
   use, such that a neighbor can predict when a mote will be listening
   or may be transmitting to another nearby mote.

2.5.  Notes

   o  if a packet chunk is incomplete in one window, prioritize
      subsequent windows from that mote

   o  send packet for a mote directly to it, and then fallback to one
      known neighbor, then to the local leader

   o  sync mode is when all link state is lost or all epochs expired,
      local leaders run the sync epochs and may coordinate to minimize

   o  resource based routing, highest resource gets undelivered packets

   o  highest leader for the whole mesh is responsible for mapping the
      full mesh, collecting undelivered's and re-routing them

   o  natural pooling around local resources, neighborhoods

   o  when you know a link's neighbors you can use their mediums active
      to estimate congestion/energy requirements
