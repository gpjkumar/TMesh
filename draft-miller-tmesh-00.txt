1.  Introduction

   Low-power devices and long-range radios, PHY/MAC for telehash [1]

   o  high density

   o  very low power

   o  long range only

   o  high lateny only

   o  peer aware meshing

   o  high interference resiliency

   o  dynamic resource optimized (powered/gateway motes become natural
      leaders)

   o  same absolute principles as telehash, no identity on the air

1.1.  The Need for Standards

   Only leaky, centralized, and commercial options.

1.2.  Basic Operation

   Overview

   o  trusted peers only, administration/provisioning adds/removes

   o  each mote has a list of RF neighbors that it learns/discovers/
      shares, a neighborhood

   o  share their resource level, local leader is who has the most

   o  concept of soft and hard "knocks", for optimal spectrum energy
      usage vs. highest compatible range

   o  discoverable mode for provisioning only, beacon's its key with a
      hard knock

   o  link is unique to each pair, every link is a unique rotating PHY
      pattern

   o  soft knock (lowest power best settings, LoRa) and then hard knock
      (highest power worst settings, FSK)

Internet-Draft                    tmesh                         May 2015


   o  each mote keep X soft knock neighbors and Y hard knock neighbors

   o  a knock is purely boolean, when one is received it means start
      listening in that mode

   o  try to keep soft/hard lists minimum but reliable, quiesce shrinks
      size of each

   o  send packet for a mote directly to it, and then fallback to one
      known neighbor, then to the local leader

   o  lost mode when all link state is lost, local leaders must help
      beacon for them to resync

   o  resource based routing, highest resource gets undelivered packets

   o  highest leader for the whole mesh is responsible for mapping the
      full mesh, collecting undelivered's and re-routing them

   o  natural pooling around local resources, neighborhoods

   o  when you know a link's neighbors you can calculate their knock
      windows and use one instead of waiting for yours

   o  soft knock is short and LNA/expensive for recipient, hard knock is
      long and cheaper for recipient


2.  Protocol Definition

2.1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC
   2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant TMesh
   implementations.

2.2.  PHY

   o  each transceiver hardware defines own best soft knock

   o  common hard knocks for compatibility and interop

   o  doesn't need whitening as encrypted packets are DC-free

   o  doesn't need CRC as packets all have authentication bits

2.3.  Link Windows

   o  link ids determine window pattern

   o  step through each bit of the id

      *  derive unique soft/hard knock parameters

      *  derive time until next window

      *  each pass through the full id is called an "epoch"

   o  a confirmed knock over any link is a sync, know the current bit
      the sender is on for all their links

   o  can use a neighbors window if no soft knock is detected, send hard
      knock

   o  sleepy motes calculate the epoch peak density across all their
      neighbors and only wake then

      *  knocks are only tried twice outside of that peak, and once
         again inside

2.4.  Knocks

   o  preamble/sync is derived from link id and window bit

   o  only identifies the window, not the sender

   o  payload is the sender's link id or a new link request

   o  immediately knock back w/ the same data as a continue/ready

   o  if no soft knock back, immediately hard knock the same

   o  after knock-knock, same preamble and packet payload

   o  knock to continue any more packets

   o  sleep after no more

   o  if busy until next transmit window, always skip it

   o  never transmit into the next receive window

   o  requires no application logic/lookups/parsing

   o  requires no spectral detection

2.5.  Flow

   1.  mote must be initially paired to another

       *  handshakes

       *  z-index priority set

       *  link established

       *  link id created (routing token and z-index byte)

   2.  existing mote informs mesh of new link

       *  sends to mesh leader for overall routing

       *  if link is a neighbor, updates other neighbors

   3.  existing mote shares mesh to new mote

       *  sends its neighbors

       *  sends the mesh top leader list

   4.  new mote attempts to reach neighbors to establish links

   5.  build/maintain neighborhood list of X soft and Y hard knock

   6.  each mote sends its neighborhood to each neighbor after it's
       changed since the last epoch

   7.  a neighbor is only considered lost after it has not responded to
       a full epoch

2.6.  Lost

   o  after any power reset (loss of link state), or after a full epoch
      of no responses to any knocks

   o  begin listening for any hard knocks, detect link id and sync to it
      then handshake there

   o  if sleepy, only listen on the lost schedule

   o  local leaders are required to hard knock per epoch on the lost
      schedule
