.# Abstract

Low-power devices and long-range radios, PHY/MAC for telehash

{mainmatter}

# Introduction

Low-power devices and long-range radios, PHY/MAC for [telehash]

  * high density
  * very low power
  * long range only
  * high lateny only
  * peer aware meshing
  * high interference resiliency
  * dynamic resource optimized (powered/gateway motes become natural leaders)
  * same absolute principles as telehash, no identity on the air

## The Need for Standards

Only leaky, centralized, and commercial options.


## Basic Operation

Overview

* trusted peers only, administration/provisioning adds/removes
* each mote has a list of RF neighbors that it learns/discovers/shares, a neighborhood
* share their resource level, local leader is who has the most
* concept of soft and hard `knocks`, for optimal spectrum energy usage vs. highest compatible range
* discoverable mode for provisioning only, beacon's its key with a hard knock
* link is unique to each pair, every link is a unique rotating PHY pattern
* soft knock (lowest power best settings, LoRa) and then hard knock (highest power worst settings, FSK)
* each mote keep X soft knock neighbors and Y hard knock neighbors
* a knock is purely boolean, when one is received it means start listening in that mode
* try to keep soft/hard lists minimum but reliable, quiesce shrinks size of each
* send packet for a mote directly to it, and then fallback to one known neighbor, then to the local leader
* lost mode when all link state is lost, local leaders must help beacon for them to resync
* resource based routing, highest resource gets undelivered packets
* highest leader for the whole mesh is responsible for mapping the full mesh, collecting undeliveredâ€™s and re-routing them
* natural pooling around local resources, neighborhoods
* when you know a link's neighbors you can calculate their knock windows and use one instead of waiting for yours
* soft knock is short and LNA/expensive for recipient, hard knock is long and cheaper for recipient


# Protocol Definition

## Terminology
In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
"SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC 2119]
and indicate requirement levels for compliant TMesh implementations.


## PHY

* each transceiver hardware defines own best soft knock
* common hard knocks for compatibility and interop
* doesn't need whitening as encrypted packets are DC-free
* doesn't need CRC as packets all have authentication bits

## Link Windows

* link ids determine window pattern
* step through each bit of the id
  * derive unique soft/hard knock parameters
  * derive time until next window
  * each pass through the full id is called an `epoch`
* a confirmed knock over any link is a sync, know the current bit the sender is on for all their links
* can use a neighbors window if no soft knock is detected, send hard knock
* sleepy motes calculate the epoch peak density across all their neighbors and only wake then
  * knocks are only tried twice outside of that peak, and once again inside

## Knocks

* preamble/sync is derived from link id and window bit
* only identifies the window, not the sender
* payload is the sender's link id or a new link request
* immediately knock back w/ the same data as a continue/ready
* if no soft knock back, immediately hard knock the same
* after knock-knock, same preamble and packet payload
* knock to continue any more packets
* sleep after no more
* if busy until next transmit window, always skip it
* never transmit into the next receive window
* requires no application logic/lookups/parsing
* requires no spectral detection

## Flow

1. mote must be initially paired to another
  * handshakes
  * z-index priority set
  * link established
  * link id created (routing token and z-index byte)
1. existing mote informs mesh of new link
  * sends to mesh leader for overall routing
  * if link is a neighbor, updates other neighbors
1. existing mote shares mesh to new mote
  * sends its neighbors
  * sends the mesh top leader list
1. new mote attempts to reach neighbors to establish links
1. build/maintain neighborhood list of X soft and Y hard knock
1. each mote sends its neighborhood to each neighbor after it's changed since the last epoch
1. a neighbor is only considered lost after it has not responded to a full epoch

## Lost

* after any power reset (loss of link state), or after a full epoch of no responses to any knocks
* begin listening for any hard knocks, detect link id and sync to it then handshake there
* if sleepy, only listen on the lost schedule
* local leaders are required to hard knock per epoch on the lost schedule
