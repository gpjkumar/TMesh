1.  Introduction

   Low-power devices and long-range radios, PHY/MAC for telehash
   [telehash]

   o  high density

   o  very low power

   o  long range only

   o  high lateny only

   o  peer aware meshing

   o  high interference resiliency

   o  dynamic resource optimized (powered/gateway motes become natural
      leaders)

   o  same absolute principles as telehash, no identity on the air

1.1.  The Need for Standardization

   Only leaky, centralized, and commercial options.
