1.  Introduction

   Low-power devices and long-range radios, PHY/MAC for telehash [1]

   o  high density

   o  very low power

   o  long range only

   o  high lateny only

   o  peer aware meshing

   o  high interference resiliency

   o  dynamic resource optimized (powered/gateway motes become natural
      leaders)

   o  same absolute principles as telehash, no identity on the air

1.1.  The Need for Standards

   Only leaky, centralized, and commercial options.

1.2.  Basic Operation

   Overview


2.  Protocol Definition

2.1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC
   2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant TMesh
   implementations.


3.  Implementation Notes

   notes
