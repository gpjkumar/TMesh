<t><list style="empty">
<t>this is a work in progress and under active development, expect significant breaking changes
</t>
</list></t>
<t>As embedded devices continue to increase in capabilities while falling in cost there is a growing challenge to manage their energy resources for wirelessly networking them together.  While there are many options for short-range 2.4GHz networks such as Bluetooth Smart (BLE), low-power WiFi, Zigbee and 802.15.4 based mesh networks, there are few choices for long-range sub-GHz mesh networking.
</t>
<t>TMesh builds on the strong end-to-end encryption and privacy capabilities of [telehash v3] by adding a uniquely matched secure Physical RF and Media Access Control protocol.
</t>
<t>The key attributes of TMesh are:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>high density - thousands per square kilometer</t>
<t>very low power - years on coin cell batteries</t>
<t>wide area - optimized for long-range (&gt;1km) capable radios</t>
<t>high latency - low minimum duty cycle from seconds to minutes</t>
<t>peer aware meshing - does not require dedicated coordinator hardware</t>
<t>high interference resiliency - bi-modal PHY to maximize connectivity in all conditions</t>
<t>dynamically resource optimized - powered motes naturally provide more routing assistance</t>
<t>zero metadata broadcast - same absolute privacy and security principles as telehash</t>
<t>dynamic spectrum - able to use any specialized private or regionally licensed bands</t>
</list>
</t>

<section anchor="the-need-for-standards" title="The Need for Standards">
<t>The existing best choices are all either only partial solutions like 802.15.4, require membership to participate like LoRaWAN, ZigBee, and Z-Wave, or are focused on specific verticals like DASH7 and Wireless M-Bus.
</t>
<t>All other options only provide incomplete or indadequate security and privacy, most use only optional AES-128 and often with complicated or fixed provisioning-based key management.  No existing option fully protects the mote identity and network metadata from monitoring.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="telehash-native" title="Telehash Native">
<t>By leveraging <eref target="http://telehash.org">telehash</eref> as the native encryption and mote identity platform, TMesh can start with some strong assumptions:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>each mote will have a unique stable 32-byte identity, the hashname</t>
<t>two linked motes will have a unique long-lived session id, the routing token</t>
<t>all payloads will be encrypted ciphertext with forward secrecy</t>
<t>retransmissions and acknowledgements happen at a higher level and are not required in the framing</t>
<t>motes are members of a private mesh and only communicate with other verified members</t>
<t>chunked encoding defines how to serialize variable length packets into fixed transmission frames</t>

</section>

<section anchor="overview" title="Overview">
<t>TMesh is the composite of three distinct layers, the physical radio medium encoding (PHY), the shared management of the spectrum (MAC), and the networking relationships between 2+ motes (Mesh).
</t>
<t>Common across all of these is the concept of an <spanx style="verb">epoch</spanx>, which is a generated set of unique window sequences shared between two motes in one <spanx style="verb">medium</spanx>.  A <spanx style="verb">window</spanx> is where one <spanx style="verb">knock</spanx> can occur from one mote to another unique to that window and epoch.  A <spanx style="verb">knock</spanx> is the transmission of a 64 byte fixed frame of payload, plus any medium-specific overhead (preamble).
</t>
<t>Each epoch is the smallest divisible unit of bandwidth and is only capable of a max throughput of 120 bits per second average, approximately 1 kilobyte per minute. Every mote has at least one receiving epoch and one sending epoch per link to another mote, and will typically have multiple epochs with other motes to increase the overall bandwidth capacity and minimize latency.
</t>
<t>The number and types of epochs available depend entirely on the current energy budget, every epoch type has a fixed minimum energy cost per window to send/receive based on the medium settings.
</t>

<section anchor="phy" title="PHY">
<t>A <spanx style="verb">medium</spanx> is defined with 6 bytes that specify the type and exact PHY encoding details.  The 6 bytes are often encoded as 10 base32 characters for ease of use in JSON and configuration storage.
</t>
<t>The first byte is a fixed <spanx style="verb">type</spanx> that determines the category of PHY encoding technique to use, often these are different modes on transceivers or different drivers entirely.
</t>
<t>Each PHY driver uses the second through fifth medium bytes to determine the power, frequency range, number of channels, spreading, bitrate, error correction usage, regulatory requirements, channel dwell time, etc details on the transmission/reception.  The actual channel frequency hopping and transmission window timing are derived from the full epoch and not included in the medium.
</t>
<t>The last (6th) byte is a fixed <spanx style="verb">divider</spanx> that lowers the density of available windows in an epoch.  This enables two motes to greatly reduce the time required waking and listening for low power and high latency applications. (format TBD)
</t>
<t>Transmitted payloads do not need whitening as encrypted packets are by nature DC-free.  They also do not explicitly require CRC as all telehash packets have authentication bytes included for integrity verification.
</t>
<t>A single fixed 64 byte payload is transmitted during each window in an epoch, this is called a <spanx style="verb">knock</spanx>.  If the un-encrypted payload does not fill the full 64 byte frame the remaining bytes must contain additional data so as to not reveal the actual payload size.
</t>
<t><list style="empty">
<t>WIP - determine a standard filler data format that will add additional dynamically sized error correction, explore taking advantage of the fact that the inner and outer bitstreams are encrypted and bias-free (Gaussian distribution divergence?), the last byte should always duplicate the first/length to ensure differentiation between payload/filler
</t>
</list></t>
</section>

<section anchor="mac" title="MAC">
<t>There is no mote addressing or other metadata included in the transmitted bytes, including there being no framing outside of the encrypted ciphertext in a knock.  The uniqueness of each epoch's timing and PHY encoding is the only mote addressing mechanism.
</t>
<t>Every epoch is a unique individual encrypted session between the two motes, with a shared secret key derived directly from the medium and other sources, and nonce based on the current window sequence. All payloads are encrypted with the <eref target="http://cr.yp.to/chacha.html">ChaCha20 cipher</eref> before transmission regardless of if they are already encrypted via telehash.
</t>
<t>Each mote should actively make use of multiple epochs to another mote and regularly include more efficient options to optimize the overall energy usage.  Every mote advertises their current energy resource level as a <spanx style="verb">z-index</spanx> as an additional mesh optimization strategy.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="mesh" title="Mesh">
<t>There is two mechanisms used for enabling a larger scale mesh network with TMesh, <spanx style="verb">neighborhoods</spanx> (MAC layer) and <spanx style="verb">routers</spanx> (telehash/app layer).
</t>
<t>A <spanx style="verb">neighborhood</spanx> is defined by motes using a shared medium and the automatic sharing of other motes that it has active epochs with in that medium.  Each neighbor mote hashname is listed along with time offset, last activity, z-index, and the signal strength.  A mote may be part of more than one neighborhood but does not share neighbor mote information outside of each one.
</t>
<t>A <spanx style="verb">router</spanx> is always the neighbor with the highest z-index in the local neighborhood. The router inherits the responsibility to monitor each neighbor's neighborhood for other routers and establish direct or bridged links with them.  Any mote with a packet for a non-local hashname will send it to the neighborhood router, whom will send it to the next highest router it is connected to until it reaches the highest in the full neighborhood mesh.  That highest resourced router is responsible for maintaining an index of all available motes/hashnames in the full neighborhood mesh.

<section anchor="private-hopping-sequence" title="Private Hopping Sequence">
<t>Most PHY encodings require specific synchronized channel and timing inputs, these are generated from the epoch's 32 byte secret via a consistent transformation.
</t>
<t>An eight byte null/zero pad is encrypted with the current epoch secret/nonce for each window and the ciphertext result is used for channel selection and window timing.
</t>
<t>The first two bytes of the ciphertext result is used for channel selection as a network order unsigned short integer.  The 2^16 total possible channels are simply mod'd to the number of usable channels based on the current medium.  If there are 50 channels, it would be <spanx style="verb">channel = ((uint16_t)pad) % 50</spanx>.
</t>
<t>The next four bytes (32 bits) are used as the window microsecond offset timing source as a network order unsigned long integer.  Each window is up to 2^22 microseconds, but every medium will have a fixed amount of time it takes to send or receive within that window and that is first subtracted from the total possible microseconds.  The remaining microsecond offset start times are mod'd to get the exact offset for that window.

<t>A unique 32 byte secret must be derived for every epoch and include the medium definition.  The additional sources for the secret depend on the context in which the epoch is used, and may range from a well-known fixed value (for discovery), shared value (for mesh, echos), or ephemeral value (pairing, private motes).  The 32 bytes the binary digest output of a SHA-256 calculation of the combined sources.
</t>
<t>The nonce input is always the epoch's current window sequence encoded as a network order unsigned double integer (<spanx style="verb">uint64_t</spanx>) 8 bytes.

</section>

<section anchor="epoch-types-1" title="Epoch Types">
<t>There are currently five different types of epochs defined:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t><spanx style="verb">PING</spanx> - when detected, only used as a source to generate an echo</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">ECHO</spanx> - only used for one-time creation of a <spanx style="verb">PAIR</spanx></t>
<t><spanx style="verb">PAIR</spanx> - only used to send initial handshakes to establish a new link</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">MESH</spanx> - encrypted telehash packets for an established link</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">MOTE</spanx> - private epoch only between two motes</t>
</list>
</t>

<section anchor="ping" title="PING">
<t>A <spanx style="verb">PING</spanx> epoch is only used as a transmission timing signal on window sequence <spanx style="verb">0</spanx>. The payload is not used to send/receive any content and is only deciphered as a source to generate an <spanx style="verb">ECHO</spanx>.
</t>
<t>When two motes have a shared secret to create this type of epoch they can then use available energy to listen for a <spanx style="verb">PING</spanx> knock at any time on the given channel for sequence <spanx style="verb">0</spanx>.  When detected, the relevant <spanx style="verb">ECHO</spanx> can be generated and sent/received in the next window relative to the <spanx style="verb">PING</spanx> knock.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="echo" title="ECHO">
<t>An <spanx style="verb">ECHO</spanx> epoch is the one-time response to a detected <spanx style="verb">PING</spanx> knock and only exists to assist with the establishment of one-time <spanx style="verb">PAIR</spanx> epochs for the handshaking process.
</t>
<t>The secret for an <spanx style="verb">ECHO</spanx> epoch is derived from the medium and the deciphered payload of the <spanx style="verb">PING</spanx>.  For discovery the payload of a transmitted <spanx style="verb">PING</spanx> must be used as another source, whereas in a neighborhood the receiving mote's hashname is the additional source to generate the secret.
</t>
<t>The single <spanx style="verb">ECHO</spanx> knock is always set to window sequence <spanx style="verb">1</spanx> relative to the received <spanx style="verb">PING</spanx> at sequence <spanx style="verb">0</spanx>.
</t>
<t>The payload is a pair of new ephemeral <spanx style="verb">PAIR</spanx> secrets, one for tx and one for rx.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="pair" title="PAIR">
<t>A pair of temporary <spanx style="verb">PAIR</spanx> epochs only follow an <spanx style="verb">ECHO</spanx> and are only used to send/receive chunk-encoded handshakes to establish a telehash link.
</t>
<t>Any <spanx style="verb">PAIR</spanx> epochs defined in the encrypted handshakes will have the same time base as the original <spanx style="verb">PING</spanx> and begin at the correct window sequences based on that.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="mesh-1" title="MESH">
<t>All <spanx style="verb">MESH</spanx> epochs follow a successful <spanx style="verb">PAIR</spanx> or are triggered by an out-of-band synchronization, their medium, time base, and unique epoch ID are a result of those processes.
</t>
<t>The secret for a <spanx style="verb">MESH</spanx> epoch is always derived from the hashnames of the two motes.  All knocks are chunk-encoded encrypted telehash packets.
</t>
<t>When using <spanx style="verb">MESH</spanx> in a neighborhood and sharing the time offsets of neighbors, any mote can then calculate keep-out channels and times of other motes based on their shared <spanx style="verb">MESH</spanx> epochs and optimize overall medium usage.  In this way, the <spanx style="verb">MESH</spanx> epoch acts as a higher QoS path between motes.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="mote" title="MOTE">
<t>A <spanx style="verb">MOTE</spanx> epoch is any privately shared and generated one between two motes.  These are created dynamically as needed to increase the bandwidth available and may have a lower QoS as they can overlap with other nearby motes.
</t>
<t>Every mote should continually try new <spanx style="verb">MOTE</spanx> epochs with a higher energy efficiency as a method to optimize communication, reserving the <spanx style="verb">MESH</spanx> epochs for only when the <spanx style="verb">MOTE</spanx> epochs are not performing or for higher priority packets.

<section anchor="mesh-2" title="Mesh">

<section anchor="discovery" title="Discovery">
<t>When a new un-linked mote must be introduced directly into a mesh and there is no out-of-band mechanism to bootstrap mote keys and time sync, a special temporary discovery mode may be enabled on any existing mote to assist.  Both motes must have the same discovery medium and secret for this process to work.
</t>
<t>The discovery epoch is used as a <spanx style="verb">PING</spanx> for both motes, with each of them transmitting their ping knocks containing offers.  Since they will both be using the same PHY channel, if possible they should first listen for a transmission in progress before sending another offer to minimize interference.
</t>
<t>The discovery ping knocks must always have a random 64 byte payload so that even if the secret is known, it is not possible for a third party to determine if the knock was a ping or not.  It is also always set to window sequence 0 so that the PHY is stable since the time of the windowing is not.
</t>
<t>Once one ping knock has been both sent and received the mote may then derive a compatible <spanx style="verb">BASE</spanx> epoch and send a knock on it or listen for other base knocks.
</t>
<t>Upon receiving any <spanx style="verb">BASE</spanx> knock the mote should immediately create the pair of <spanx style="verb">INIT</spanx> epochs and begin sending/receiving unencrypted handshakes until a <spanx style="verb">LINK</spanx> epoch is established.
</t>
<t>This functionality should not be enabled/deployed by default, it should only be used when management policy explicitly requires it for special/public use cases or temporary pairing/provisioning setup.

<section anchor="sync" title="Sync">
<t>The sync mode takes advantage of the fact that every epoch makes use of a shared medium that is divided into channels, such that every sync epoch will have some overlap with other private link epochs that a mote is transmitting on.  When any mote sends any knock that happens to be on the same channel as one of their <spanx style="verb">PING</spanx> epoch's (sequence 0), they should then attempt to receive an <spanx style="verb">ECHO</spanx> knock exactly one window period after the transmission.
</t>
<t>The local leader should attempt to maximize their use of sync epoch overlapping channels to allow for fast resynchronization to them, even to the point of sending arbitrary/random knocks on that channel if nothing has been transmitted recently. When a mote detects that it is disconnected, it should also send regular knocks on the sync epoch channels of nearby known motes.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="zindex" title="z-index">
<t>Every mote calculates its own <spanx style="verb">z-index</spanx>, a uint8_t value that represents the resources it has available to assist with the mesh.

</t>
<t>The mote with the highest <spanx style="verb">z-index</spanx> in any neighborhood is known as the <spanx style="verb">local leader</spanx>.

<t>The z-index also serves as a window mask for all of that mote's receiving epoch windows by powers of two.
