<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>As embedded devices continue to increase in capabilities while falling in cost there is a growing challenge to manage their energy resources for wirelessly networking them together.  While there are many options for short-range 2.4GHz networks such as Bluetooth Smart (BLE), low-power WiFi, Zigbee and 802.15.4 based mesh networks, there are few choices for long-range sub-GHz networking.
</t>
<t>TMesh builds on the strong end-to-end encryption and privacy capabilities of [telehash v3] by adding a uniquely matched Physical RF and Media Access Control protocol.
</t>
<t>The key attributes of TMesh are:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>high density - thousands per square mile</t>
<t>very low power - years on common batteries</t>
<t>wide area - optimized for long-range capable radios</t>
<t>high lateny - low duty cycle, 10s of seconds of sleep</t>
<t>peer aware meshing - does not require special purpose coordinator motes</t>
<t>high interference resiliency - bi-modal PHY to maximize connectivity in all conditions</t>
<t>dynamically resource optimized - powered motes naturally provide more assistance</t>
<t>no identity on the air - same absolute privacy and security principles as telehash</t>
</list>
</t>

<section anchor="the-need-for-standards" title="The Need for Standards">
<t>The existing best choices are all either only partial solutions like 802.15.4, require membership to participate like LoRaWAN and ZigBee, or are focused on specific verticals like DASH7 and Wireless M-BUS.
</t>
<t>All other options only provide incomplete or indadequate security and privacy, most use only optional AES-128 and often with complicated or fixed provisioning-based key management.  No existing option attempts to protect the mote identity and network metadata from monitoring.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="telehash-native" title="Telehash Native">
<t>By leveraging <eref target="http://telehash.org">telehash</eref> as the native encryption and mote identity platform, TMesh can start with some strong assumptions:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>each mote will have a unique stable 32-byte identity, the hashname</t>
<t>two linked motes will have a unique long-lived session id, the routing token</t>
<t>all payloads will be encrypted ciphertext</t>
<t>retransmissions and acknowledgements happen at a higher level and are not required in the framing</t>
<t>motes are members of a private mesh and only communicate with other verified members</t>

<section anchor="overview" title="Overview">
<t>TMesh is the composite of three distinct layers, the physical radio medium encoding (PHY), the shared management of the spectrum (MAC), and the networking relationships between 2+ motes (Mesh).
</t>
<t>Common across all of these is the concept of an <spanx style="verb">epoch</spanx>, which is a fixed period of time of 2^30 microseconds (about 18 minutes).  An epoch is broken into 256 <spanx style="verb">windows</spanx> (about 4.2 seconds each) where one <spanx style="verb">knock</spanx> can occur from one mote to another with a specified PHY unique to that epoch.  A <spanx style="verb">knock</spanx> is the transmission of up to 128 bytes of encrypted payload, plus any PHY-specific overhead.
</t>
<t>Every mote has at least one receiving epoch and one sending epoch per link to another mote, and will often have multiple epochs with other motes to increase the bandwidth available from the minimum 1/4 kbps average per epoch.  The number and types of epochs available depend entirely on the current energy budget, every epoch type has a fixed minimum energy cost for its lifetime.
</t>

<section anchor="phy" title="PHY">
<t>An <spanx style="verb">epoch</spanx> is defined with a unique 16-byte identifier, specifying the exact PHY encoding details and including random bytes that act as a unique seed for that epoch.
</t>
<t>The first byte is a fixed <spanx style="verb">type</spanx> that determines the category of PHY encoding technique to use, often these are different modes on transceivers.  The following 1-7 bytes are headers that are specified by each type of encoding, and the remaining 8 bytes are always a unique random seed.
</t>
<t>The PHY encoding uses the headers to determine the power, channel, spreading, bitrate, etc details on the transmission/reception, and must use the random seed to vary the transmission frequency and specific timing offset of each window in the epoch.
</t>
<t>Transmitted payloads do not need whitening as encrypted packets are by nature DC-free.  They also do not need CRC as all telehash packets have authentication bytes included.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="mac" title="MAC">
<t>There is no mote addressing or other metadata included in the encoded bytes, no framing other than the length of the payload.  The uniqueness of the timing and signalling of each epoch is the mote addressing mechanism.
</t>
<t>The epoch 16 bytes are used as an AES-128 key, and the current count of windows since the first sync is used as the IV.  All payloads are encrypted before transmission even if they are already encrypted telehash packets.
</t>
<t>Additional MAC-only packet types are defined for exchanging the current set of epochs active between any two motes.  An additional pre-set <spanx style="verb">lost</spanx> mode is defined for bootstrapping two motes from scratch or if they loose sync.
</t>
<t>Each mote should actively make use of multiple epochs with more efficient options to optimize the overall energy usage.  Every mote advertises their current energy resource level as a <spanx style="verb">z-index</spanx> as an additional mesh optimization strategy.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="mesh" title="Mesh">
<t>There is two mechanisms used for enabling a larger scale mesh network with TMesh, <spanx style="verb">neighborhoods</spanx> (MAC layer) and <spanx style="verb">routers</spanx> (telehash/app layer).
</t>
<t>A neighborhood is the automatic sharing of other epochs one mote has active with every other mote it is linked with.  Every mote also supports a simple MAC-level window sequential forwarding service between neighbors to aid with discovery and resiliency.  The neighborhood map shared from each mote includes a unique addressible epoch id, the epoch, microsecond offset, and signal strength.
</t>
<t>A router is always the neighbor with the highest z-index, which inherits the responsibility to monitor each neighbor's neighborhood for other routers and establish direct or bridged links with them.  Any mote with a packet for a non-local hashname will send it to their router, whom will send it to the next highest router it is connected to until it reaches the highest in the mesh.  The highest resourced router is responsible for maintaining an index of all available motes/hashnames in the mesh.
