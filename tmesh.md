.# Abstract

Low-power devices and long-range radios, PHY/MAC for telehash

{mainmatter}

# Introduction

Low-power devices and long-range radios, PHY/MAC for [telehash]

  * high density
  * very low power
  * long range only
  * high lateny only
  * peer aware meshing
  * high interference resiliency
  * dynamic resource optimized (powered/gateway motes become natural leaders)
  * same absolute principles as telehash, no identity on the air

## The Need for Standards

Only leaky, centralized, and commercial options.


## Basic Operation

Overview


# Protocol Definition

## Terminology
In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
"SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC 2119]
and indicate requirement levels for compliant TMesh implementations.
